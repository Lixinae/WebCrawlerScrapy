# WebCrawlerScrapy
Web crawling using spiders on different websites.


You need scrapy installed

To start a spider :
- scrapy crawl <spiderName>

Example :
- scrapy crawl AmazonSpider

Note : The project is just starting yet, it will be updated later to include more spiders for more website.
Right now it's a test run on how spiders really work
